    <p> Now this one is a special because it is the <b>8th</b> dish on the restaurant Yukihira's secret menu. </p>
    <p> One of the most flashy dishes in the Food Wars anime has to be the <b>transforming furikake rice dish</b>. It is the first dish cooked by Soma Yukihira for Erin Nakiri</p>
    <p> The dish transforms as a result of the jello cubes of meat melting and changing the form of the egg. </p>
    <p> For this dish in particular you will need to get several ingredients, most of which you can find at your local grocery store.
        But, there will be some less popular ingredients that you will need to procure elsewhere.
        We have managed to find them at an Asian grocery market. So, try your luck there first. 
    </p>
    <p> Also one last tip before we begin, When you are cooking we recommend using sesame oil in particular as it gives off an amazing nutty flavor and scent that just merges perfectly with the ginger and garlic. </p>

        <li> Pour everything from the pan into the Broth. Simmer on medium-low for 20 minutes. </li>

        <li> Add the gelatine to 1/2 of water and let bloom for 5 minutes. Mix the gelatine into the water until fully dissolved. Add the gelatine mix to the broth mix. </li>
