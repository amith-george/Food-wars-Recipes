    <p> Now this is one of the dishes where Soma had been sabotaged and his whole ingredients were ruined but he still managed to pull off and blow everyones minds. </p>
    <p> Yeah, it's that good! That's one of the few reasons why it is even on this website. </p>
    <p> In this dish, creamy mashed potatoes are mixed with things like onions and mushrooms which add depth and umami, then it's shaped into a cylinder and wrapped in bacon. </p> 
    <p> Finally, the gotcha pork roast is oven baked so that the fat from the bacon penetrates the potato and adds a meaty flavour. </p>
    <p><b> So let's get started on making this masterpiece! </b></p>

    <h2> The Preparation: </h2>

    <p> Now we are back to the fun part, the cooking! </p>

    <ol>
        <li><b> Gotcha! Pork Roast: </b></li>
        <ol>

            <li> Place the peeled/cut potatoes inside a large pot and fill with cold water until the potatoes are fully submerged. </li>
            <li> Add 1 tsp salt, a pinch of pepper, 1 sprig of rosemary and a whole garlic clove to the pot and place it on the stove. </li>
            <li> Bring the water to a rolling boil and cook until the potatoes are soft to the core. (This should take about 10-15 minutes depending on the size.)</li>
            <li> Pour the potatoes into a colander to drain the water, give them a shake and discard the rosemary and garlic clove. Let the potatoes sit for 1-2 minutes to let out the excess steam.            </li>
            <li> Transfer the potatoes to a large mixing bowl and mash until smooth.</li>
            <li> Add 50ml of whole milk and 1 tbsp unsalted butter to a small microwavable bowl. Cover the bowl and microwave for 40 seconds at 500W or in intervals until the butter has melted.            </li>
            <li> Add 1 tsp of chicken bouillon powder to the warm milk and butter and mix until dissolved.             </li>
            <li> Pour the mixture into the potatoes and mix until smooth. Cover the bowl and set aside for later.            </li>
            <li> Heat a frying pan on medium and add 1 tbsp unsalted butter and ½ tbsp Worcestershire sauce.            </li>
            <li> Once the butter is melted, add ½ a diced onion and fry until slightly softened.            </li>
            <li> Add 3 diced garlic cloves and 1 finely diced eryngii mushroom and fry everything together until the onions start to turn translucent.             </li>
            <li> Remove the pan from the heat and allow to cool for a few minutes.            </li>
            <li> Transfer the contents of the pan to the bowl of mashed potato along with 1 tsp of parmesan cheese and a sprinkle of dried parsley.            </li>
            <li> Mix until all the ingredients are evenly distributed, cover the bowl so the mixture doesn't dry out and then leave to cool to room temperature.            </li>
            <li> Take a sheet of plastic wrap and place the mixture in the middle. Shape into a thick cylinder and firmly wrap.            </li>
            <li> Chill in the fridge for about 30 minutes.            </li>

        </ol>

        <li><b> The Baking: </b></li>
        <ol>

            <li> Preheat your oven to 180 degrees Celsius. (Approx 355°F)            </li>
            <li> Remove your mashed potato from the fridge and wrap each end with 1-2 rashers of bacon. Wrap the rest of the bacon (4 long rashers) around the cylinder of mashed potato and try to make sure there aren't any gaps.            </li>
            <li> Wrap the bacon with butchers twine to keep it secure and place 1 sprig of rosemary on the top.            </li>
            <li> Transfer the gotcha pork roast to a roasting tin and place it in the oven on the top shelf. Bake for 20 minutes or until the bacon is golden.            </li>

        </ol>

        <li><b> Red Wine Sauce: </b></li>
        <ol>

            <li> Heat a small saucepan on medium and add 1 tbsp butter.            </li>
            <li> Once the butter is melted, add 150ml red wine, 1 tbsp soy sauce, 1 tbsp mirin and 1 tsp sugar.            </li>
            <li> Bring to a boil and allow it to bubble for a few minutes to burn off the alcohol in the wine and mirin.            </li>
            <li> Remove from the heat.            </li>

        </ol>

        <li><b> The Serving: </b></li>

            <li> Cut off the butchers twine and transfer it to a serving plate. (Use a spatula to help you lift it.)            </li>
            <li> Drizzle with the red wine sauce.            </li>
